5) Added phpconsole function - /functions.php

[############################################ 09/08/2012 ############################################]
1) function fsol_remove_inline_css_rc_widget_style() in /functions.php to remove inline css from the Recent Comments widget.  Prevents an unexpected style from showing up on the site.
2) function fsol_customize_meta_boxes() in /admin/functions.php.  Allows to remove standard meta boxes from the post/page screens
3) Moved $content_width global to functions/custom.php as this will be accessed frequently along with the fsol_custom_post_types() function.  Started to standardize documentation structure in the documents.

[############################################ 09/09/2012 ############################################]
1) Made some minor changes to various files.  Realized we should go with a parent/child theme setup for all the different configurations. We will have more control over updating the primary template and allow proper customization to child themes.  Going to refactor to move in this direction.
2) Removed /scss directory and placed in root.
3) Move functions in /functions/custom.php into /functions.php.  These functions will end up being overriden in the /setup.php file of the child themes.
4) Updated primary stylesheet with normalize.css v2.0.1 and box model support.  List of @mixins under way.

[############################################ 09/10/2012 ############################################]
1) Determined would need a mixins.scss and style.css in the parent to properly accommodate child themes.
2) Tested child theme and style sheet configuration is working correctly.
3) Added google_font() function to /functions/utlities.php

[############################################ 09/13/2012 ############################################]
1) Created a "Client Setup" page under the "Settings" tab in the admin menu.  This allows for client detail information to be placed in the back-end.  This is generally useful for accessing data on the fly that can be changed.
2) fsol_admin_menu() function added to /admin/functions.php.  Allows you to move sub items to main bar.
3) fsol_admin_css() function added to /admin/functions.php.  Allows to specify a custom admin panel stylesheet.  Created default /admin/style.scss | /admin/style.css files.
